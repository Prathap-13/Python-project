The Dice Roller Application is a simple yet engaging program designed to simulate a dice
rolling game for two players. Developed using Python, the application features an intuitive
graphical user interface (GUI) created with tkinter, allowing users to interact with the game
effortlessly. The main objective of the project is to provide an entertaining platform for
users to play a virtual dice game and visualize the outcomes using various data visualization
techniques.
The application allows users to enter the names of two players, specify the number of
times they want to roll the dice, and then simulate the dice rolls. After each round, the
application displays the result of each roll, determines the winner of the round, and updates
the overall score for each player. The final results are presented in both textual and graphical
formats, providing users with a comprehensive overview of the game.
